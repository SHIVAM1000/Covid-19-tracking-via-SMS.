# Covid-19-tracking-via-SMS.
In this project you will get to know how you can track the active and dead cases of any state through message. 
I have used python and sql, and twillo for sending message to user.
First you need to create a database in mysql and create table.In whih you will store names of a person,phoneno and his state name.
Now we will connect the database with python.
for fetching the live active and dead cases we will use api https://api.covid19india.org/data.json
Now create an account in twilo and copy the account sid and token and paste it in the covid19 message.py
now run the program you will get the meeage instantly on your mobile no.
Thankyou
